# wordsquirt ‚úíÔ∏èüí¶
 Python3 based text snippet expander for macos. My grandfather used to call writing implements "word squirters". Written in Python for macOS.

## Python Package requirements (one day I'll learn to package my software):

```
tinydb
rumps
pynput
py2app
```

## Sources:
~~Based originally off this article:
[https://chrisrosser.net/posts/2017/01/02/macos-system-wide-snippet-database/](Macos System Wide Snippet Database - chrisrosser.net)~~

Current iteration is from scratch.  

## Set up
Compile with:

``python setup.py py2app``

Then run the resulting app. Since this program monitors and controls the keyboard you will need to give it Keyboard Monitoring and Accessibility permissions when macOS prompts. On my machine I get what appear to be errors about missing modules during build but an app is still produced and runs fine.

When running the program as a script, the program crashes whenever it attempts to send key presses. However, it works as intended when compiled as app using py2app. On that note, I also had to delete and manually regrant Accessibility and Keyboard Monitoring whenever I made a new build. Otherwise the expansion wouldn't trigger, with no apparent errors.

## Todo:
- Implement drop down menu to delete existing expansions.
- Make procedure for adding a new expansion more robust.
- Possibly monitor the config and expansions file for updates to allow autoreload.
- Add icon and other cosmetic features.
- Add prompt to edit trigger string.
- Add menu item displaying current trigger string.
- Add menu to trigger expansions from dropdown.
